nwcplugin-api
=============

This is the official documentation for the NoteWorthy Composer plugin API, which is currently undergoing extensive development. A mature plugin API is slated for release in **NoteWorthy Composer Version 2.75**. Until this release is generally available, all API mechanisms should be considered as experimental, and subject to change or removal before final release.

For those interested in testing the current NWC 2.75 plugin mechanism, you probably want to start with the (Plugin API Overview)[api/overview.md) page. A copy of the latest testing plugin includes in the NWC 2.75 beta previews can also be found in the (test)[test/) folder of this repository.
