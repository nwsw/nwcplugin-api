nwcplugin-api
=============

This is the official documentation for the NoteWorthy Composer plugin API, which is currently undergoing extensive development. A mature plugin API is slated for release in **NoteWorthy Composer Version 2.75**. Until this release is generally available, all API mechanisms should be considered as experimental, and subject to change or removal before final release.

For those interested in testing the current NWC 2.75 plugin mechanism, you probably want to start with the [Plugin API Overview](api/overview.md) page. The universal **Hello World** demonstration can be found in the [examples folder](examples/).

The latest beta preview edition of NoteWorthy Composer 2.75 can be found here:
